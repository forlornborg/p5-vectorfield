#p5-vectorfield


demonstrating a vector field of a finite number of vectors as declared by the numVectHoriz and numVectVert variables.
currently noise progresses the vector x and y two dimensionally. Will change to progress three dimensionally, to give a "hill" effect instead of the current "wave" effect.
